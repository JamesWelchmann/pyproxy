PyProxy
#############

PyProxy is a server and client library for remotely executing Python code.
It has an experimental architecture.
The author is curious how well these abstractions play out at higher levels.

.. important::
  NOTE: This project is very new. Please do not run it in a production environment.
  Currently the server will crash on certain messages and there is no TLS support.
